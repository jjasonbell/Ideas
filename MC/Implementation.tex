\begin{enumerate}
\item A domain is selected, either by a human or by an algorithm.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Humans can use contextual information, and can guess ahead of time about how easy a particular domain will fit into the remainder of the process, in particular evaluation and prototyping.
	\item A computer has the advantage of a large amount of data to explore and a willingness to pursue any domain.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Once a domain is selected, a script collects the text from a Google search of the domain name.  This text comes from the first $N$ pages that Google finds.  
\item The text is converted into a network structure, with each page serving as an element of a corpus, the words as nodes, and the co-occurrences of words within a page as edges.
\item Use measures of centrality, or measures of divergence from the word distribution (such as Kullback-Leibler) 
\end{enumerate}
