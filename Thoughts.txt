Innovating as a non-specialist?  Is it possible?  Is it worth trying? Flexibility vs. depth.  What if you go to a domain that is bad at what you are good at?  Like wrestlers used to do so well in distance running.  

Can you make evolution less blind?  How?  Analytical plus mutation algorithm? Like a metropolis within gibbs sort of.
