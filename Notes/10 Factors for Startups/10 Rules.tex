\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with a large group of three or four founders. 
\item Make certain a marketing or sales person is a member of the founding team.
\item It's all abut teams: hiring, creating, building.  Talent and cohesion.  
\item Don't worry about your exit; focus on creating value instead.
\item Manage your cash tightly.
\item Start with a market, as opposed to trying to create one.
\item Find a great first customer, and please them.
\item Build a board that is a great ``sounding board," not just a good watchdog.
\item Make your product or service high quality and unique, then brand it in a way people won't forget.  It's more important for your brand to be noticeable than like-able, if the product is good.
\item Enjoy the ride.  If you like it, you're much more likely to succeed, so do something you think is cool.
