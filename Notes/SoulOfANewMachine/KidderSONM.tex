Here I seek to record points worth remembering from the book.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item The four rules of Data General's Eagle Team:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compete for resources. 
	\item Work Faster than the competition (in this case another group in the same company was the competition.)
	\item ``Sign-up."  Basically this is a Law of Consecration applied to work.
	\item Reward!  The payoff for success is big and awesome.  
	\end{enumerate}

\item West and Alsing: driven, visionary politician and brilliant, shy, genius team up.  Reminds me of Jobs and Wozniak.
\end{enumerate}
