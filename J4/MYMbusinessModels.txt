1. What would Mind Your Major look like if it had micro-transactions?  It seems like this would be better suited for an addictive game, but you could pay for the next semester’s recommendation or something.

2. You could have students “auction” their educational path.  The highest bidding business gets to tell the student what to study, in return for a lump sum.

3. Join up with an institution (University, MOOC, or a State like Iowa) and build the platform specifically for them, and then sell the package to them.  (Our original business model, but search around for the right institution.  Maybe we could build it for High Schools?)

4. Freemium model.  Revenue comes from several sources: upgraded accounts, gathering of information from usage, and possibly advertising or promotional arrangements.

5. Get a sponsor for MYM, something that would be motivating by itself, like an organization that wants to promote STEM majors.  The government maybe?  A group that wants to help black people?

6. We could do a subscription model.  This is different from 3 because it’s a general-purpose site and lots of people would pay for it.

It doesn’t matter much where you go, it matters which degree you get, except for at the top firms.  Then it matters where you go and whether you played lacrosse or did crew.
