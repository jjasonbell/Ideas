The principles in the book:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Adjacent Possible
\item Liquid Networks
\item The Slow Hunch
\item Serendipity
\item Error
\item Exaptation
\item Platforms
\end{enumerate}

Johnson's recommendations:
\begin{quote}
Go for a walk, cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent.  Build a tangled bank
\end{quote}

He mostly built a theory, but didn't spend a long time trying to convince the reader of causality.  That may or may not invalidate the recommendations to some degree.
